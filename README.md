# FidoAssignment

This repository was created as part of the process of applying for an iOS programming job at Fido (https://www.fidobank.app/).  The idea was to create an iOS program to retrieve recent news articles.  

You are free to reuse the code (for what it’s worth) for any purpose, so long as you provide attribution.  Do note that the code was written in about three hours with zero previous research or forethought, so it is in a relatively “quick and dirty“ state and not suitable for production, just to show how to do some basic things.
